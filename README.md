I made this mp3 player because I was bored on a plane
## Usage
This mp3 player is customizable to your liking, to add songs simply include it in Resource folder as an mp3 file.
## Further Updates
1. In the near future (in about a month), I plan to add a shuffle and auto play option.
2. An option to save custom playlists
## Far Future Updates
An option to potentialy browse for songs you may want to add off of youtube.
Make this program exectuble through a simple script for each operating system i.e. Linux, MacOS, Windows.
## Requirements
1. Java
2. Javafx library (https://openjfx.io)
3. If you want to run without having to set the classpath and other configuration options then use an IDE like Eclipse or          IntelliJ (Eclipse: https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) (IntelliJ: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
    * Must add javafx library to classpath. For Eclipse and IntelliJ: Project Properties --> Java Build Path --> Classpath -->       Add Library
