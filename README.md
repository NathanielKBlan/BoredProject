# BoredProject
I made this mp3 player because I was bored on a plane
## Usage
This mp3 player is customizable to your liking, to add songs simply include it in the songs array in MainMenu.java, most songs in the array are meme songs. You must also download the song and add it in the Resource folder as an mp3 file, it must be named with no spaces, and using the same characters and cases that you used for the song name in the songs array.
## Further Updates
1. In the near future (in about a month), I plan to add a shuffle and auto play option.
2. An option to save custom playlists
## Far Future Update
An option to potentialy browse for songs you may want to add off of youtube or your system
